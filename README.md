PROTOTYPE 3:

In the development of my weather app which is designed for the city of Bristol (in further prototypes it will be able to call weather information of different cities), it includes various features, such as real-time weather updates and a digital clock and other weather information for the user to see. 
Advantages:
It incorporates local storage to able the website to operate seamlessly in offline mode, reducing reliance on an internet connection. The addition of a timestamp for data caching allows users to be able to see how fresh the information is. Also, by caching weather data locally contributes to improved website performance by minimizing the need for repeated API calls. It ensures a more responsive user experience. For optimal performance, the implementation of dynamic caching strategies based on user behaviour and data update frequencies is recommended. When something might happen the internet (does down). To resolve these issues, it helps the website work offline and since its offline it will be using caching. I have also added the time of when the data has been previously cached. It will store the data so u can see how accurate the data is. So, it isnâ€™t outdated. Since the network depending on your location might not be the best in terms of quality and on top of that there are millions of people using the network to browse the internet, so this is another reason to make it offline. This makes us reliant on the server and it's going to be a lot cheaper to host and will let more users access the sight without overloading the website since its cached.
Disadvantages:
Security concern arises from storing sensitive information, such as API keys, directly within client-side JavaScript since it exposes API keys to anyone inspecting the webpage source, posing potential security risks. A more secure approach involves managing API keys on the server-side, away from public visibility. Offline functionality is advantageous, heavy reliance on server-side scripts introduces potential challenges during server downtimes or script-related issues. Implementing robust error handling mechanisms will contribute to a more resilient user experience. This also will cost money for since your essentially saving money from not using the weather data subscriptions but by using your own server it will cost more.

By utilizing the Chrome Developer Tool known as "Lighthouse," I can assess the performance of the overall website. I achieved a score of 100% in the performance category, indicating the overall speed of the page. It's essential to note that this metric may vary based on the device in use and the display quality, encompassing factors such as content, images, and layout. Understanding these elements is crucial, especially considering users' limited attention spans.
Furthermore, the website received a 64% rating for SEO, suggesting that it may not be entirely mobile-friendly. This issue could be attributed to aspects like page sizing, including font dimensions. Addressing these concerns will contribute to optimizing the site's accessibility and enhancing the user experience across different devices.

 
SEO and Mobile Friendliness: The SEO score indicates potential challenges related to mobile friendliness. Optimizing the website's layout and content for various devices, along with responsive design, is crucial for improved search engine visibility and user accessibility.
In summary, while the presented weather application exhibits commendable features, addressing security, optimizing performance, and ensuring mobile friendliness will contribute to an enhanced and more resilient user experience.
